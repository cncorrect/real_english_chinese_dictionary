# A Real English to Chinese Dictionary Project 
- When Literal Translation Doesn't Work

I'd like to start a new project aimed to improving mutual understanding between English and Chinese speakers.

Literal translation (i.e., word-to-word translation) often fails to convey the true meaning of a phrase. The meanings of words can diverge significantly between western languages and Chinese. Therefore, I want to start a project to collect English and Chinese word pairs with their true meaning equivalents. The rules are as follows:

1. Post English and Chinese word pairs that you believe have the same meaning. The format is 'English, Chinese'.
2. Anyone can question the word pairs and discuss their real meanings.
3. You can commit your contributions. 

Here are some examples:

1. yellow, 柠檬黄
2. Bless you! (after sneezing) , 你待上哪儿啊？ (a response to someone sneezing, roughly meaning "Where are you off to?")
3. That's so cool!, 这真是太有趣了！
